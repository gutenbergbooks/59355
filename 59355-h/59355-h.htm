The "Hungarian Partridge"&mdash;the Gray Partridge.<br />

<span class="medium">(<i>Perdix cinerea.</i>)<br />

By <span class="smcap">Walter H. Rich</span>, Portland.</span>
</h2>

<p>For the purpose of advancing the interests of our supply of game
and its protection and propagation, a number of local sportsmen
have formed a society under the title of "The Cumberland County
Fish and Game Protective Association." As first fruits of their
endeavors, and as earnest of their intentions, they have imported and
liberated in five or six colonies in the neighborhood of Portland,
fifty pairs of "Hungarian Partridge" (<i>Perdix cinerea</i>), generally
considered the prime game bird of Europe.</p>

<p>The society has secured the passage of an act establishing a
close time of four years, with the proper penalties for non-observance
thereof.</p>

<p>In its numerous species and varieties the race is scattered all
through temperate Europe, prospering best in its milder regions and
shunning extremes of either heat or cold. Its range extends from
southern Scandinavia and England on the north and west, Naples
on the south, eastward through Persia, India and Tibet, to China.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
As is natural over so wide an extent of territory, there is much
variation in size and coloring, but it is upon the great wheat plain
of Hungary, where they thrive best and are exceedingly numerous,
that the birds of this species attain their greatest size.</p>

<p>The relationship of the Old World Partridges with our "Quails,"
as we usually term them, seems to be very close. The American
group, as most of our members probably know, is separated from
its over-sea relatives chiefly because its members have a more or less
distinct serration on the cutting edge of the mandible near the tip.
This is scarcely apparent in some species. The bill in our American
group (<i>Odontophorinæ</i>) seems more arched, giving it a
shorter and heavier appearance. In the Hungarian Partridge the
bill is noticeably flatter and longer than in our "Quails," and the
side view of the head gives a very pigeon-like appearance, save, of
course, the lack of the tumid membrane at the base of the bill as
shown in the pigeon.</p>

<p>Of our American Partridges the species most suggesting this bird
is the Plumed Quail of California, though <i>Perdix</i> lacks the plumes,
is rather more brownish in his tones, and is of generally lighter
coloring. Our new citizen is plump and stocky, powerful in figure,
short of wing with a short tail, carried low in Quail fashion. I
weighed the largest of those which I had and he tipped the scales at
eleven ounces. He was in fair order, not fat, and in condition might
have weighed thirteen or fourteen ounces. The meat is dark,
which rather surprised me, for I had taken it for granted that it
would be white.</p>

<p>As many of our members may be unfamiliar with the appearance
of this bird, a brief description may not be out of place here. Their
markings are as follows: top of the head, dark yellowish brown;
throat, light reddish buff, with a broad band of the same shade running
back above the eyes to the hind head; above, in general a
brownish or yellowish ash, lightening toward the rump, the feathers
here, as also on the tail coverts, crossed by a broad subterminal
band of chestnut, and everywhere the feathers are finely barred with
broken, irregular dark lines; the scapulars with more or less reddish
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
or chestnut, and central lines of pale buff; the tail short, carried
low like a Quail's, bright reddish brown; the flight feathers
brownish, the primaries still darker, and all cross-barred with irregular
bands of ochraceous, black-margined; the upper breast bluish
ash, growing lighter below, and brownish on the flanks, where the
feathers show a broad band of chestnut near the tips, and are crossed
by fine vermiculations of darker color, sometimes unbroken lines,
but oftener their mere suggestions made up of small dots; a chestnut
"shield," or "horse-shoe," of considerable size in the middle of
the lower breast; under tail coverts, light yellowish brown, very
faintly and finely barred; feet and legs, brownish flesh color; bill,
gray-blue; eyelids, gray-blue or pale flesh color; iris, brown or red-brown;
naked patch just behind the eye of light orange.</p>

<p>"The dark chestnut 'horse-shoe' on the gray breast is nearly
obsolete in most adult females; female invariably distinguished by
widest buff bands on black scapulars and adjoining wing coverts,
which in cock are light brown with black vermiculations and chestnut
blotches. The latter sex, moreover, has gray instead of brown
sides to the neck." (<i>Ogilvie Grant.</i>)</p>

<p>There are great variations in coloring. Specimens from dry soil
are said to exhibit the richest hues, while some are occasionally
taken showing white "horse shoe." A particularly dark variety
has been denominated <i>montana</i>. There are even records of hybrids
between this species and the red-legged Partridge, and also with the
Scotch Grouse.</p>

<p>East of the Altai and Tian Shan this species is replaced by the
allied <i>Perdix daurica</i> (<i>barbata</i>), which has lanceolate feathers on the
side of the throat and a black "horse-shoe" on a golden-buff breast.
Other species in South Tibet, North India, Northwest China, and
North Tibet. These last are more hardy, ascending the mountains
to the snow line.</p>

<p>The Gray Partridge pairs in February and nests in April, and
success in raising the brood depends much on excess of wet or
drought. The nest is made upon the ground, a circular cavity,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
lined with grass, in the herbage and often in exposed situations.
Eggs are from nine to twenty, drab or bluish. It is wellnigh impossible
to see the bird upon her nest, where her blending colors of
gray and brown so closely match the surroundings of dry grass and
herbage. Both parents tend the young and employ the same wiles
and tricks to mislead the intruder as does the Ruffed Grouse or the
Bobwhite in a similar situation. Large numbers of eggs are never
hatched, and many a chick falls victim to his enemies in fur or
feather, owing to the exposed position of the nest or the feeding
ground.</p>

<p>These Partridges roost upon the ground at night. Late in the
fall they "pack up" into large coveys, much as do our Prairie
Chickens, and these are said to be equally as wild at this time as are
the Chickens in the same circumstances. Rarely does the Gray Partridge
desert the open for the woods, even in hot weather, only seeking
shelter under low brush, or the broad leaves of the crops, the
corn, the cabbage, the turnip, the clover clump. The larger the
cultivation in a district the better their chance of prospering.</p>

<p>Often pursued, they trust to their legs for escape, or may crouch
low in the grass, motionless, trusting to their plumage's matching
tones to render them invisible. When flushed they rise with a loud
whirr&mdash;the flight rather labored until under way, when they glide
on bowed wing rapidly and easily. As to their qualities as game
birds it is somewhat too early for us to speak with full decision.
They are highly esteemed in Europe, but are more often driven than
hunted over dogs, mainly, it is said, because the cultivated ground
has so little of waste spaces in hedgerows or brush to lead them to
lie close, so they are apt to run unseen to the end of the furrows
and so flush wild. They are swift of foot and very quick in all their
movements. If I were to express any opinion at present, I should
say that I should expect them to do a great deal of running before
the dog, especially when the young have become well grown, and
from the little I have seen I should judge them to be far inferior in
wing power to Grouse or Quail.</p>

<p>I was fortunate enough to have a colony of these birds left in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
my care for setting out, and I took them home with me. During
the evening I brought a male bird in to make the acquaintance of
the family. I spent the half-hour in which he lay snuggled under
my chin in scratching his head. At first his heart jumped in lively
fashion but he soon quieted down and merely blinked his eyes in
deep content. It seems as though they would tame very easily.</p>

<p>In their coop they used a great variety of language; they
clucked like a Grouse; they chattered like a Blackbird; they snapped
their bills like an Owl; they "jawed" like a Parrot; they made a
guttural note of alarm like the "br-r-r-r" of a startled Pigeon; they
hissed like a Black Duck guarding her nest, or like a Thomas cat
whose dignity is ruffled not quite enough for anger; and, in addition,
they are said to "crow" at evening. Their Latin name, <i>Perdix</i>, is
said to be a fairly close imitation of their call. English? Continental?
Or ancient Roman pronunciation?</p>

<p>Next evening, May 6, 1909, about sundown, I carried them into
a clearing in the woods where was a couple of acres of newly turned
soil sloping down to a brook, the north side well wooded, on the
south open to the sun, and a good bit of cultivated land near by. I
placed the box upon the ground with a corner of the burlap cover
loosened so that they might easily get out. They got out; they
stood not upon the order of their going but went at once. The box
was scarcely set down when they began to stream out into the dusk.
They made only a short flight&mdash;twenty yards or so, the longest not
over forty&mdash;and dropped into the plowed ground. A few scurried
into the woods at the right. In a moment the gloom was filled with
curious noises as the scattered birds began calling each other. It
was as though every wheelbarrow in the neighborhood had lifted up
a voice of protest against the high price of oil. Presently they gathered
together, the last straggler came out from the woods, and all
collected on a little hummock in the midst of the plowed ground,
and viewed their surroundings, as it seemed to me, with no great
approval. They squeaked and called for a few minutes until finally
the whole covey made off on foot, entering the edge of the brush
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
and apparently settled down for the night. Here we left them and
another experiment in game propagation is under way.</p>

<p>Will they survive or no? It is to be hoped that the optimists
may win this time, for it would be a great pity to lose these beautiful
little creatures. For their welfare during all but the bitterest of
our weather there need be no fear, but the furnishing of the table of
a bird who depends mainly on grain and insects for its sustenance
may become a vital issue when our northern winter descends upon
us, and when the door of the North Pole swings open about January
15th to stand wide until March 20th, and the north wind comes
down, swirling and heaping the snow through the woods and over
the open, I greatly fear that these little folk will regret the day they
left the billowing grain fields and sunny vine-clad slopes of far-off
Hungary.</p>

<h2 id="Occasional_Notes_on_Birds_at_Sea">Occasional Notes on Birds at Sea.</h2>

<p class="caption">By <span class="smcap">Dr. William C. Kendall</span>, Scientific Assistant U. S. Bureau of Fisheries.</p>

<p>The following notes were made by the writer while serving as
naturalist on the U. S. Fish Commission Schooner, "Grampus," in
1891, 1894 and 1895, during cruises connected with enquiries relating
to mackerel. These cruises extended from off the coast of Virginia
to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and even southern Labrador, but
all of the notes are not now available, thus rendering those following
more or less fragmentary, desultory and indefinite. They are copied
almost verbatim from the available notes, about the only change being
that of adjusting such technical names as were used to the more
modern nomenclature of "Knight's Birds of Maine." Owing to the
writer's unfamiliarity with birds, unfortunately they could not always
be identified with certainty when at a distance, and in the case of the
Petrels not even when in hand. Therefore when the species is in
the least in doubt the technical name when used is questioned.
Many references are to Phalaropes without specifying the particular
species. This is due mainly to inability to determine which they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
were. But always when identifiable the Northern Phalarope was the
more common.</p>

<p>The only excuse the writer has for offering these notes for publication
in the <span class="smcap">Journal</span> is that he was urged to do so by officers of
the society. So, ever desirous of obliging his friends, he has complied,
even though contrary to good judgment and discretion.</p>

<h2 id="A_Pet_Cedar_Waxwing">A Pet Cedar Waxwing.</h2>

<p class="caption">By <span class="smcap">Mrs. Della F. Wentworth</span>, South Portland.</p>

<p>September 17th, 1908, a young Cedar Waxwing was found
helpless and almost unconscious on the lawn. On examination its
left wing seemed dislocated, and the left leg from the knee to the
foot was bent toward the right foot. We think that the dense fog
which prevailed the night before and that morning may have prevented
the bird from seeing the electric wires overhead and so been
the means of the accident.</p>

<p>After being brought into the house he revived, and little by
little recovered the use of his injured leg. After five months the
wing still hangs down nearly touching the perch, though, strange to
say, he can spread it fully, and close it nearly to the dimensions of
the well wing when closed.</p>

<p>Cedric, for so we have named him, can hop from perch to perch
of the canary bird cage and from the floor of the cage to the
perches. When I take him out of the cage on my finger, Cedric
will sometimes try to fly, but succeeds only in flopping down upon
the floor, often striking heavily. Although frequently trying to fly
upward, he cannot use his left wing well enough to raise himself
wholly from the floor.</p>

<p>Cedric does not appear to regard his cage as a prison, and,
though he sometimes shows fear of strange inanimate objects, is not
afraid of any person, and will take his favorite tidbits from any
offering hand. When first we offered food we found black cherries
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
and choke cherries were his choice, but when cherry time had
passed he reluctantly accepted as a substitute dried currants such as
are used in cooking. It is interesting to watch him eat a cherry or
currant. Seizing it quickly in his bill and pointing his bill upward
he rolls it over and over in his mouth, as a juggler revolves a ball in
the air, then suddenly one quick gulp and the tiny ball has
disappeared.</p>

<p>Cedric is very fond of live flies, and angleworms cut in half-inch
sections are graciously received, but grasshoppers and beetle-like
bugs are rejected. Cedric seems to like flies best when their wings
are buzzing, and if he is at the farther side of the cage when a fly
is offered him he will jump to the perch near the fly and oftentimes
seems to catch the fly in his bill before his feet have touched the
perch. He comes as near taking the fly "on the fly" as is practicable
within the confines of his cage. In the absence of flies and
worms, fresh beef, veal and lamb, cut in tiny fragments, are eagerly
swallowed, but never in great quantity. Cedric is also fond of fruit,
and will eat apple cut in bits, or scraped fine, and small pieces of
orange or banana.</p>

<p>Our little bird protege always knows when he has eaten
enough, and when his needs are satisfied he will leave the most
tempting morsels and resolutely fly or hop to the opposite end of the
cage and turn his back on us as if to say, "I won't even look at it
lest I may be tempted"&mdash;a lesson to the featherless bipeds who
pride themselves upon their superior wisdom.</p>

<p>When very hungry, about eighteen flies seem to be a satisfying
portion, though often half as many suffice. A half dozen bits of
meat the size of a green pea, and a less amount of fruit are sufficient.
Of course these meals are frequent, six or eight a day,
while he always has access to the dried currants which we keep in
his food dish, and which are washed and soaked before putting in
the dish. If the currants are too dry, he will roll them about in his
bill and toss them scornfully over his shoulder. Any food which we
offer him that he does not want is promptly thrown down. We
tried him on cedar cones and the berries of the ground juniper, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
he would have none of them. The berries of the bush honeysuckle
he ate until we got him cherries, when he utterly refused the honeysuckle
berries, and threw them out of his dish. Seeds and sand he
will not notice, but pecks regularly at the cuttlefish in his cage.
When hungry he announces it in shrill staccato whistles, but when
his hunger is satisfied, he will seek an upper perch and preen his
feathers, and often sing to us in a soft, sweet whistle, which seems
full of love, confidence and content, though it may have a shade of
vague regret.</p>

<p>On hearing our footsteps after a period of solitude, we are
greeted with a welcoming whistle, which is very delightful. This,
and the more strident tones of our Poll Parrot, convince us that
"they miss us at home."</p>

<p>At night, though in the full glare of the electric light, Cedric is
ready to settle down to quiet, and when asked if he is ready to go to
bed, he will flutter all his feathers and snuggle up in a corner, when
we cover the cage with a paper and bid him "good night." If
offered food at night he snaps his bill at us and makes an indescribable
little querulous sound in his throat and will peck at our fingers
if we continue to annoy him.</p>

<p>The cage is placed on the end of the piano and often when we
play and sing, Cedric sits very still and accompanies us with his
soft, whispering trill.</p>

<p>Every morning Cedric has his bath in the big bath tub, where
he is sprinkled with cold water from a bath sprinkler. He spreads
his feathers and prances about apparently in great delight. He
always seems sorry when his bath is ended. Notwithstanding his
daily bath, he frequently goes through the motions of taking a
second bath, this time in his drink dish, though no water gets
farther than his eyes.</p>

<p>Cedric has been moulting for two months or more. When
found his breast was whitish, mottled with dark spots, like the breast
of a thrush. He had no red spots on his wings and was not the
beautiful purplish fawn color which is now showing on back and
crest and breast, as the new feathers make their appearance. Now
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
very few mottled feathers remain on his breast, which is nearly
covered with the pretty fawn-colored feathers. The feathers of the
belly are light lemon color. The lemon-tipped tail feathers have
come out, one or two at a time, and are now nearly all new. The
vivid black forehead and chin are new, but the crest is in such a
state of pinfeatherdom that one would hardly think our little friend
had any crest to speak of. Long and anxiously have we looked
forward to the day when the little red tips would appear on the
wings, and February 10th the first one was observed on the lame
wing. It is salmon colored, rather than the vivid red of sealing
wax, as yet, but we are watching closely for all the changes as they
come, and shall hope soon to see our pet arrayed in the full insignia
of the very daintiest groomed of all the distinguished Cedar Waxwings.</p>

<p>Our great regret is that we cannot cure him and set him free
with his kind. It is pathetic to hear him chirp at his own image in
the mirror, and for some time he has been tearing paper in his cage
and trying to make string or paper stay upon his perch, apparently
as the foundation of his nest. Much as we love him, we would
gladly set him free could he but hold his own in the bird world and
escape his enemies. Could we but find someone who could set his
wing so that he could fly among his kind, we would be gladly content
with only the memory of a brave, patient, trusting, dainty,
delightful friend.</p>

<h2 id="The_Bohemian_Waxwing_in_Maine">The Bohemian Waxwing in Maine.</h2>

<p class="caption">By <span class="smcap">Ora W. Knight</span>, Bangor.</p>

<p>About the first of March the writer noticed an item in the <i>Bangor
Commercial</i> to the effect that Mr. Clark had seen large flocks of
the Northern Waxwing at Lubec during the past winter, but paid
no further attention to the event, knowing that Mr. Clark would
doubtless record the matter in proper shape in a more scientific
medium in due season.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span></p>

<p>On March 9th, Dr. W. H. Simmons, of Bangor, called me up on
the telephone and said he wished to tell me about the flock of
Bohemian Waxwings which he had seen daily near his home since
the middle of February. He stated that there was a good sized
flock of the birds, and that they had been feeding daily on the fruit
of a mountain ash tree which grew beside a window of his home,
where he could look down on them. The birds had been coming
for some time before he paid any especial attention to them, thinking
that they were doubtless Pine Grosbeaks, until he happened to
notice that they all had crests, which he knew was not a fact with
the Grosbeaks. He then examined the birds critically and identified
them as Bohemian Waxwings by their having white wing bars,
yellow tips to their tail feathers, and by their prominent crests. Dr.
Simmons also states that in February, 1908, a flock of birds of the
same size were daily in the habit of visiting the same locality, but
at that time he took no particular notice of them, though he is
inclined to believe that they were of the present species.</p>

<p>March 11th, the writer and Mr. Winch visited the locality for
the purpose of personally seeing the birds. They were not about
Dr. Simmons' premises, but he was able to give us an idea of the
general route they pursued, so that finally we found the flock feeding
on rotten crab apples in an orchard several blocks away. Yes,
there is no question as to their identity, as they were positively
Bohemian Waxwings. They were busily engaged in eating the
rotten apples, sometimes eating the pulp itself, at other times pecking
the apple to pieces and eating the seeds, which they swallowed
without shelling out the meat as do the Pine Grosbeaks.</p>

<p>Now and then the birds would fly from the tree in which they
were feeding to a neighboring tree, uttering low lisping notes and
whistlings which sounded very appreciably different in character
from the notes of the Cedar birds.</p>

<p>They were very tame, so that I was able to get up within fifteen
feet of them and secured six exposures of them with my pocket
kodak. As if to show their kindly and obliging nature, they waited
patiently until I was through taking photographs, and then at a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
signal the whole flock flew away in a compact bunch. Later in the
day Mr. Winch secured one at the same locality, to which they
returned.</p>

<p>From Dr. Simmons I was able to learn somewhat of their feeding
habits. They did not seem to eat the pulp of the mountain
ash berries but delved into the berry to obtain the seed while the
pulp was dropped on the snow beneath. They seem to be more or
less regular in their feeding habits, frequenting certain localities in
a given route or circuit through the immediate neighborhood for a
distance of a dozen blocks or so.</p>

<p>One of the teachers at the neighboring grammar school, who has
aspirations to be somewhat of an ornithologist, had an item printed
in the <i>Bangor Commercial</i> to the effect that the Cedar Waxwings
had been wintering in the immediate neighborhood. Dr. Simmons
saw this item in print and immediately called me up on the telephone
to call my attention to the error, thus happily resulting in
giving me much valuable information and the pleasure of seeing the
birds as well.</p>

<p>It is well on to twenty years ago, when the writer was a high
school boy, just beginning his scientific career, that the Bohemian
Waxwings last visited this locality. In those early days Bohemian
Waxwings and other northern birds used to visit us rather more frequently
than they do now, as we used to see them every three or
four years, but now that twenty years has elapsed from their last
call to the present visit it is indeed a pleasure to be able to see them
once more.</p>

<p>Practically all our winter birds seem to come in fewer numbers
and less frequently and regularly than formerly, though even in
those early days such eccentric creatures as the Bohemian Waxwings,
Crossbills, and to a lesser extent the Pine Grosbeaks, could
never be depended on.</p>

<p>Formerly we always found the Crossbills in winter, not at any
other season, while now about Bangor both species of Crossbill occur
more commonly and regularly as summer birds in May, June, July
and August.

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Birds of the Boston Public Garden.</span> A Study in Migration. By Horace
Winslow Wright, with an Introduction by Bradford Torrey, and illustrations.
238 pages. $1.00 net. Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Co., Boston and New
York.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">The Journal</span> has no hesitation in designating this volume as
one of the most satisfactory local lists of birds ever published. For
nine years the author has been a constant student of the migration
of birds at the Boston Public Garden, adjoining Boston Common.
Frequent excursions through that delightful locality in the early
morning at the season when the birds are traveling northward or
southward have made Mr. Wright perfectly familiar with the conditions
which govern their arrival and departure. The data which
he gives are valuable for all New England students, as well as a
service beyond estimate for the young people who are making their
first observations in that locality. A description of the Public Garden
and the vegetation it contains is of exceeding interest. The illustrations
are excellent half-tone engravings of the trees which attract
different rare species of birds and the locations which they
love. Particulars of the noteworthy features of the migrations for a
series of years are given, both from the personal observations of the
author and from the added testimony of other reliable observers.</p>

<p>More than three-fourths of the volume is devoted to an annotated
list of the birds of the Boston Public Garden and incidentally
of the Common, in migration, 1900-1908. This list is exhaustive
and authority for numerous records and dates is freely given. An
examination of the list is of unusual interest on account of its clearness
and completeness, as well as the systematic order in which it is
arranged. Many birds which one would expect to visit the Public
Garden frequently in migration are noted as very rare. On the
other hand, birds often are recorded as common which one would
not expect to find their way to that locality. The book, as a whole,
is of great value to the bird student, and it is so well done that it is
worth a place in the library of any ornithologist.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Journal</span> prints in this issue the first instalment of an interesting
series of notes of birds at sea, by Dr. William C. Kendall,
Scientific Assistant U. S. Bureau of Fisheries, gathered in 1891,
1894 and 1895 on the United States Fish Commission Schooner
Grampus, the cruises extending from the coast of Virginia to the
Gulf of St. Lawrence and even to southern Labrador. The notes
for 1891 and 1894 are here printed and those made in 1895 will be
published in the September <span class="smcap">Journal</span>. We are under obligation to
Dr. Kendall for this valuable contribution.</p>

<p>Mr. Dana W. Sweet, the new Secretary and Treasurer of the
Maine Ornithological Society, has for some years compiled, in an
able manner, the migration reports sent to him by members of the
Society. In addition to his duties as Secretary and Treasurer, Mr.
Sweet will continue to edit the migration reports, and this will be
eminently satisfactory to all members.</p>

<p>The attempt to introduce the Hungarian Partridge into Cumberland
County will be watched with considerable interest, to see
whether the birds liberated will take kindly to their new habitat.
In this issue Mr. Walter H. Rich writes of the circumstances attending
the introduction of the bird and contributes an excellent original
portrait, drawn from life.</p>

<p>During the winter of 1908-1909 the Bohemian Waxwing
appears to have been seen by a number of reliable observers, mostly
in Eastern Maine. Reports of its occurrence continue to come in,
so that it is sure that the region visited by the bird was quite extensive.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span></p>

<p>All subscribers to <span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, who have not paid for the
year 1909, are requested to send their dollars as soon as convenient.
The money is needed to pay the current expenses of publishing
<span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, the membership dues, which should be paid to the
Treasurer, not being sufficient for that purpose. Subscribers, as
heretofore, should remit to the editor.</p>

<p>Attention is again called to the necessity of having a good
department of notes, and this can only be accomplished when the
members make frequent and generous contributions. The new
associate member, Mr. Louis E. Legge, has charge of this feature
of the magazine, and under his direction there is no doubt that it
will be a credit to the Society. It is hoped that members will not fail
to respond to Mr. Legge's request for material to make a good
showing.</p>

<p>Members who have copies of Vol. 7, No. 1, March, 1905, Vol.
8, No. 1, March, 1906, or Vol. 9, No. 4, December, 1907, and who
do not care to preserve them for binding, will do a favor by sending
them to the editor. The file is nearly exhausted for those issues of
<span class="smcap">The Journal</span>, and there are frequent calls for complete sets from
libraries in different parts of the country. Those who have copies
issued previous to 1905 should preserve them carefully and send
them to the editor unless they are intended for binding. There are
many of the early issues of <span class="smcap">The Journal</span> which are now lacking,
and it is getting to be difficult to make up a complete set.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lincoln's Sparrow and Mourning Warbler in Portland,
Maine.</span>&mdash;On May 30, 1909, I received as one of the victims
of a plate glass window on Bowdoin St., Portland, a Lincoln's Sparrow
(<i>Melospiza Lincolnii</i>), a male in good plumage. This is apparently
the fifth recorded specimen for the vicinity of Portland. On
June 1, 1909, from the same source, an adult male Mourning
Warbler (<i>Geothlypis philadelphia</i>). This appears to be the third
recorded specimen for the vicinity of Portland. The other two
specimens are recorded by Mr. N. C. Brown, May 31, 1876, Deering,
<i>Brown Bull. Nutt. Orn. Cl.</i>, Vol. <small>I</small>, p. 95, and May 30, 1868,
Cape Elizabeth, Me., <i>Proc. Part. Lac., N. H.</i>, Vol. <small>II</small>, p. 1. Both
birds are preserved and in my possession.&mdash;<i>Miss Helen M. Lewis,
Portland, Maine.</i></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="smcap">The White-Crowned Sparrow.</span>&mdash;After walking a number
of miles and visiting several places in a vain search for the White-crowned
Sparrow, I gave up all hope of finding it this spring, but
on May 26th I was so fortunate as to see a fine specimen of the
male bird. He was perched on a post which stands at the edge of a
tract of swampy land and appeared to be resting. I called the
attention of my companion to him, and as he did not appear to
object to our presence we took a long look at him. Should any
person in this part of the state see this most interesting bird at a
later date, I should be very glad to know it.&mdash;<i>Sara C. Eastman.
Portland, Maine.</i>

<h2 id="Bird_Notes">Bird Notes.</h2>

<p>Notes and observations upon bird life within our State are earnestly desired from all our readers
for publication in this column, and should be sent to Louis E. Legge, 22 Dow street, Portland, Maine.</p>

<p>We note with much satisfaction the increasing frequency with
which the members of our society report to this <span class="smcap">Journal</span> their
ornithological observations. This is an important part of our duties,
one to another, and should be shared in by all interested in bird
life. The <span class="smcap">Journal's</span> columns are always open to contributors of
items of general interest relating to Maine birds, and we trust our
members will, though this medium, disseminate such knowledge as
they personally possess.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Birds at Grand Manan.</span>&mdash;Allan L. Moses sends from
Grand Manan a list of birds seen there in March, April and the
early part of May. Among the most interesting notes are a thousand
Northern Phalaropes, a large flight of Sharp-shinned Hawks
April 6th, Sparrow Hawks abundant on the same day, a Sora Rail
heard on April 21st, a large flight of Ruby-crowned Kinglets from
April 23rd to 25th. Mr. Moses reports on March 6th a Wilson's
Phalarope, the only time he has seen it there. He records for the
first time on the island an Ipswich Sparrow on March 26th. A Little
Blue Heron was seen April 17th, this being the fourth time it has been
recorded at Grand Manan. Brunnich's Murre was seen March 31st,
Dovekie May 4th, Pigeon Hawks common after May 7th, Yellow
Palm Warblers common after April 14th, Myrtle Warblers common
after April 17th, Redpoll April 22nd, American Pipit May 11th.&mdash;<i>Louis
E. Legge, Portland.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Mourning Doves.</span>&mdash;March 19th, I discovered a pair of Mourning
Doves in the old Deering Golf Links, near the junction of
Falmouth Street and Deering Avenue. My attention was first
called to them by their size, and their peculiar movement on the
ground. They were feeding quite close together, and finally I
succeeded in making them take wing, when I at once discovered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
what variety of birds they were by the heart-shaped tail and the
white feathers on each side. From their action on the wing, I
should imagine that they were a pair, male and female. Possibly
these birds are not rare, but I never recalled seeing but one other
specimen, which I shot eleven years ago, late in October.&mdash;<i>Silas B.
Adams, Portland.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Bohemian Waxwings in Bangor.</span>&mdash;The flock of Bohemian
Waxwings, which has been seen about the streets of Bangor since
early in February, had not left us March 30th, 1909. I had not
seen them until that date, although I had made many efforts to do
so. I was walking down Court Street, near my own home, when
I heard the note which I knew to be a Waxwing note, but enough
different from that of the Cedar bird so that I at once guessed that
I was at last to see our own rare visitors. I discovered a good
sized flock among some apple trees in a neighbor's yard. For a
good half hour I watched the birds at close quarters. They were
busy with the old fruit on the trees and flying back and forth to the
ground, the snow under the trees often being thickly dotted with
them. They did not seem to mind at all my close proximity,
neither did they mind some chattering English Sparrows who came
around to see what was going on. But the strident note of a crow
seemed to disturb their nerves somewhat. At his near call they
would rise and fly off a short distance, but would soon return again
to the same trees. A couple of White-breasted Nuthatches and a
Chickadee, seemed to be on very friendly terms of companionship
with them. I had ample opportunity to observe all the distinguishing
features of the Bohemian Waxwing, the shape of the crest, the
white on the wings, the chestnut coloring of under tail coverts and
forehead, which in the sunlight looked almost a rich orange. I think
I never enjoyed a more interesting and beautiful bird sight.&mdash;<i>Bertha
L. Brown, Bangor.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Phillips Bird Notes.</span>&mdash;I had never been able to find the Fox
Sparrow in spring until last year. This spring I have found this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
species common, and most of the birds that I saw were singing.
The song, when heard a little distance away, impressed me as being
remarkably similar to that of the White-crowned Sparrow. I saw
one White-crowned May 11th, two May 16th, and two the 17th.
They were all in song. May 5th, I came upon a flock of nine
Pipits. This is my earliest record. The same day I saw a large
compact flock of Redpolls. I estimated the number to be between
100 and 200. The Sparrow Hawks have been fairly common this
spring. With me this is a rare species. Up to date, the present
month seems to have been most unfavorable for the observation of
Warblers. They are not inclined to sing much, owing to the cold,
backward weather. A few have arrived at the usual time, but it
takes perseverance and sharp eyes to find them.&mdash;<i>Dana W. Sweet,
Phillips.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Fox Sparrows Sing in Bangor.</span>&mdash;The 2nd of April I was
delighted to hear again the inspiring song of the Fox Sparrow. I
rushed out of doors with my glasses, and sure enough the little fellow
was perched on a high branch of a young birch tree in our garden,
his cinnamon back gleaming in the sunlight, and his joyous notes
fairly crowding from his bursting little throat. This is the earliest
spring record that I have of the Fox Sparrow. I first learned to
know the song five years ago. Since then, every spring, numbers
of the birds have visited our grounds, scratching among the leaves on
the hillside, and singing exuberantly in the trees, generally staying
with us about ten days or two weeks in April. As yet my little
songster seems to be alone, but I hope soon to welcome his friends.
Some bird books say the Fox Sparrow sings only on his northern
breeding grounds; but I and several of my bird-lover friends know
very well that of late years, at least, they sing around Bangor. In
our own garden, and also in another garden somewhat similarly
situated in another part of the city, we enjoy their most beautiful
ringing song every April.&mdash;<i>Bertha L. Brown, Bangor.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">More Bohemian Waxwings.</span>&mdash;Mrs. Elizabeth H. Marks, of
Yarmouth, writes that Miss Ellen F. Paine, of Bangor, reports a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
flock of Bohemian Waxwings at Bangor, the week previous to
March 7th. The birds were positively identified&mdash;<i>W. H. Brownson,
Portland.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Killdeer Plover.</span>&mdash;Sunday, April 4th, while out for a walk
looking for birds, I was very much gratified to see a Killdeer Plover.
It was in fine plumage and was a beautiful bird.&mdash;<i>H. W. Jewell,
Farmington.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Spotted Sandpiper Lights in Bushes.</span>&mdash;While out looking
for birds back of the depot here at Farmington, I saw a Spotted Sandpiper
fly and light on a bush which hung out over the water. They
have done this before when I have been at the same place. There
is a small creek back of the depot and a sewer runs into it from the
village. The Sandpipers were here picking up bugs and worms
from the mud on the banks of the creek.&mdash;<i>H. W. Jewell, Farmington.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">An Albinistic Hermit Thrush.</span>&mdash;On the morning of May
17th, 1909, the writer saw an albinistic Hermit Thrush at Westbrook,
Me. The bird was not captured. The entire head and upper part of
the neck and throat appeared to be white and immaculate, and the
large spots of the breast were resumed below the albinistic portion,
their irregular upper border showing the irregular termination of
albinistic portion. The unusual number of Hermit Thrushes seen
that morning made it appear that a movement was in progress. The
bird has not been seen since. Should any one see the bird, it is to
be hoped that it may be reported through these pages.&mdash;<i>Arthur H.
Norton, Portland.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">A Robin's Strange Nesting Place.</span>&mdash;I found a year or two
ago what seemed to me to be an interesting incident, which was in
the shape of a Robin's nest built on a ledge, the ledge being on a
level with the surrounding land. A small bush gave protection
from the blazing rays of the sun. The nest was six feet from the
track (Sandy River Railroad), where four passenger trains passed,
also several freight trains each day, but did not disturb the bird in
the least.&mdash;<i>H. W. Jewell, Farmington.</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Notes from Franklin Co.</span>&mdash;I saw a Wood Thrush near Farmington
village, May 21st. I had visited the same place the morning
before without hearing it. I saw another May 24th, near my home
in Avon. May 23d, I saw a Philadelphia Vireo. It was singing in
a clump of small trees on a bank in a field. The same day I saw a
Veery with a pure white place on its upper parts. It seemed to be
on the wing near the rump, about the width of a feather, and one-half
to three-fourths inches long.&mdash;<i>Dana W. Sweet, Phillips.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Late Myrtle Warblers.</span>&mdash;On account of illness I have been
unable to watch the migration of birds except from the piazza of my
cottage in South Portland. As late as May 22nd, a considerable
flock of Myrtle Warblers frequented the small gray birch trees which
abound here. There were from twenty-five to forty individuals, in all
grades of plumage. The adult males are very brilliant in slaty blue,
black and yellow. This date seems to me to be quite late for so
many of these birds to be in this section of the state, as they rarely
nest here. A few Yellow Palm Warblers are with the Myrtles, and
it is late for them to be so far south. Brown Thrashers, Catbirds,
Baltimore Orioles and Yellow Warblers are quite numerous around
the cottage. A large flock of Tree Swallows fly around the field all
day, seeking insects in the air, but often settling down among the
bayberry bushes and varying their early fare with the waxy berries.&mdash;<i>W.
H. Brownson, Portland.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Highland Lake Migrants.</span>&mdash;While I have not been out at
all this spring, as is my custom, to watch for the migrants, I have
seen a few on the way to my camp at Highland Lake, as noted below;
March 27th, 1 Bluebird; April 11th, 5 Phoebes, 1 Pine Warbler;
April 19th, 2 Yellow Palm Warblers; April 19th, 2 Vesper Sparrows;
April 27th, 3 Spotted Sandpipers; May 2nd, Black-throated
Green Warbler, Nashville Warbler, Barn Swallow, Blue-headed
Vireo; May 9th, Kingfisher; May 15th, Catbird; May 16th, Ovenbird,
Redstart, Chestnut-sided Warbler.</p>

<p>Mr. Fred Frost reports seeing a flock of 42 Canada Geese going
over the Western Promenade March 25th.</p>

<p>Mr. Harry Hanson reports two Song Sparrows wintering near
and about Deering Oaks. The pair were observed at various times
during November, December and January&mdash;<i>Louis E. Legge, Portland.</i>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
